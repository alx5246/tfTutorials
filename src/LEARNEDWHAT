I would like to enumerate things I have found that may not be imbedded directly in the tutorials!

1) For question essentailly that boils down to passing data form input pipeline to gpu/gpus. This is a good example,
   because it talks about allocating to and from the GPUs and how to call them and CPUs.

2) A git repository with a huge number of examples "aymericadamien/TensorFlow-Examples". This has a bunch of good
   examples covering a number of different topics and implementations.
