# In most of the examples I find for tensorflow, they read in binary data. For example, the CIFAR10 reads in binary
# data as well. So what I am doing here is mostly copying from the CIFAR10 example reader:
# tensorflow/models/tutorials/image/cifar10/cifar_10.py, and looking at the how-to on Reading data.
#
# The files and guides that helped me here,
# 1) File that reads binary data: tensorflow/models/tutorials/image/cifar10/cifar_10.py
# 2) A how-to by TF: https://www.tensorflow.org/how_tos/reading_data/
# 3) Reading binary with TF example: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33648322/tensorflow-image-reading-display
# 4) Raeading TFRerocrds, using tf.train.shuffle_batch(), tf.Coordinator(), and tf.train.start_queue_runners
#    https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/how_tos/reading_data/fully_connected_reader.py
#
# We are have a complete pipeline for binary data.

        a filename_queue: A queue of strings with the filesnames to read from.

        An object representing a single example, with the following fields:
        height: number of rows in the result (32)
        width: number of columns in the result (32)
        depth: number of color channels in the result (3)
        key: a scalar string Tensor describing the filename & record number
        for this example.
        label: an int32 Tensor with the label in the range 0..9.
        uint8image: a [height, width, depth] uint8 Tensor with the image data
